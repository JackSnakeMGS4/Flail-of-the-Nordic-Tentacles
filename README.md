# Proto_Game
WIP game. Will be an RPG inspired by Ys I and II with a sprinkle of viking culture and alien sci-fi absurdity.
This is Ys for the uninitiated: https://youtu.be/8k-iheVIEug
Story direction (not set in stone): It's 643 AD in Lokum. A child was just born in the month of Ylir... day of Tysdagr.
Unbeknowst to the seafaring Vikings of Lokum, a U.F.O is on a crash collision course to the temple of Odin.
